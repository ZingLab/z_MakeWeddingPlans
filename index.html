            <h2>Your Pre-Wedding Beauty Timeline</h2>
            
            <div class="timeline-block">
                <h3>3-6 Months Before</h3>
                <p>Begin these beauty regimens early to see transformative results by your wedding day.</p>
                
                <div class="product-section">

                    </a>
                    <h4>Daily Sun Protection</h4>
                    <p class="product-name"><a href="https://amzn.to/3E4bJLa" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">EltaMD UV Clear Face Sunscreen SPF 46</a></p>
                    <p>The foundation of any bridal beauty routine begins with proper sun protection. This dermatologist-recommended sunscreen does more than just prevent sun damage—it's specifically formulated for sensitive and acne-prone skin types, making it perfect for stressed pre-wedding skin.</p>
                    <p>Begin using this daily (yes, even in winter!) to prevent sun spots and discoloration. Your wedding photos will thank you for the even-toned complexion that results from consistent sun protection. The lightweight, oil-free formula won't clog pores during these potentially stressful months.</p>
                    <div class="beauty-tip">
                        <h5>Bridal Beauty Tip:</h5>
                        <p>Apply this sunscreen every morning, even on cloudy days. It contains niacinamide which helps calm redness—perfect for combating pre-wedding stress breakouts.</p>

                    <p class="product-name"><a href="https://amzn.to/3XJ2437" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Vitamin C Face Moisturizer</a></p>
                    <p>For that coveted bridal glow, incorporating vitamin C into your skincare routine months before the wedding is essential. This powerhouse moisturizer combines hydration with the brightening effects of vitamin C to transform your complexion over time.</p>
                    <p>Consistent use helps fade dark spots, evens skin tone, and promotes collagen production for firmer, more radiant skin. The antioxidant properties also protect against environmental stressors that can dull your complexion during high-stress wedding planning periods.</p>
                    <div class="beauty-tip">
                        <h5>Bridal Beauty Tip:</h5>
                        <p>Use this in the morning after cleansing and before sunscreen. For maximum effectiveness, start at least three months before your wedding day to see transformative results.</p>

                <h3>1-3 Months Before</h3>
                <p>Time to focus on treatments that create noticeable improvements in skin texture and hair health.</p>

                    <p class="product-name"><a href="https://amzn.to/3E09rwy" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Redken One United All-In-One Leave In Conditioner</a></p>
                    <p>Beautiful bridal hair starts with healthy hair. This multi-benefit leave-in treatment delivers 25 benefits, from heat protection to frizz control, making it the perfect pre-wedding hair care essential. Professional stylists recommend beginning intensive hair care several months before your wedding to ensure your locks are in peak condition.</p>
                    <p>This lightweight formula detangles, conditions, and primes hair without weighing it down, creating the perfect canvas for any wedding hairstyle. Whether you're planning an elaborate updo or flowing waves, this leave-in conditioner ensures your hair will be manageable, shiny, and camera-ready.</p>
                    <div class="beauty-tip">
                        <h5>Bridal Beauty Tip:</h5>
                        <p>Use after every wash on damp hair, focusing on mid-lengths and ends. For extra protection, apply a small amount to dry hair before using heat styling tools during trial runs of your wedding hairstyle.</p>

                    <p class="product-name"><a href="https://amzn.to/4iTJEW0" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Mighty Patch™</a></p>
                    <p>Even with the most diligent skincare routine, pre-wedding stress can trigger unexpected breakouts. These hydrocolloid patches are a bridal emergency kit essential, drawing out impurities and dramatically reducing the appearance of blemishes overnight.</p>
                    <p>Keep these on hand throughout your wedding planning journey, but especially in the final weeks when stress levels peak. They work while you sleep, extracting fluid and reducing inflammation without the drying effects of traditional spot treatments. The translucent design makes them nearly invisible, so you can even wear them during daytime wedding errands if needed.</p>
                    <div class="beauty-tip">
                        <h5>Bridal Beauty Tip:</h5>
                        <p>Apply to clean, dry skin at the first sign of a blemish. For stubborn spots, use nightly until your wedding day. Pack extras in your emergency kit for your wedding weekend.</p>

                    <p>Start using this base coat in the weeks leading up to your wedding for stronger, healthier nails. The formula fills in ridges and imperfections, creating a smooth canvas for your bridal manicure. It also helps prevent the yellowing that can occur with repeated polish application during your trial manicures.</p>
                    <div class="beauty-tip">
                        <h5>Bridal Beauty Tip:</h5>
                        <p>Schedule your manicure 1-2 days before the wedding, not the day before, to allow adequate drying time. Bring your own base coat to ensure the salon uses the best products for your special day.</p>

                    <p>The lightweight formula won't compete with your perfume but adds a beautiful layered dimension to your bridal scent profile.
